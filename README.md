# Scanning multiple web sites with 'ZAP Mass Baseline' and serving result reports as markdown with 'Caddy'

* Here we have scripts to run [ZAP Baseline Scanning](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/docker/baseline-scan/) against a series of target URLs
* The list of target URLs is maintained as markdown file (`mailings.md`) served with help of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)
* The results of scanning are stored as markdown files and also served with help of Caddy

## Prerequisites

### Caddy container configuration and static data

* See Caddy container configuration and static data in `caddy/{etc,data}`
* Copy the directory `caddy` with its content to `/srv/docker/`. As a result you should have `/srv/docker/caddy/{etc,data}` directory structures
* There should be a directory `/srv/docker/caddy/data/src/reports/markdown/m_<ID>` with file `mailings.md` containing a list of target URLs to scan
* Edit the mentioned file (`mailings.md`) to add your targets according to its structure
* The following is an example of `mailings.md` content. Lines which start with `üü¢` symbol are parsed. Fields of columns **Site**, **Report URL**, and **Notification Emails** are exxtracted and used to scan targets and store the results

```
On/Off | Site | HTTP Req Status | HTTPS Req Status | Report URL | Notification Emails
------ | ---- | --------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | -------------------
üü¢ | [example.com](https://example.com) |` 301 => https://example.com/ `|` 200 `| [show...](/reports/r_mytseOSqv3WfUqZ1jCatVD8OgaTqsC9J9P30C4SS/example.com_history) |security@example.com
üî¥ | [www.example.com](https://www.example.com) |` ‚ùó no DNS record `|` ‚ùó no DNS record `| - | -
```

* The name of the directory where the mentioned file located (`m_<ID>`) contains the ID passed thereafter to the **ZAP Mass Baseline** container (its `mass-baseline` command)
* In the following example the ID is `wiho6vrjbt68gemclnfj9we4azv8eobfrfcfv34x`, and the directory name is `m_wiho6vrjbt68gemclnfj9we4azv8eobfrfcfv34x`

```
/srv/docker/caddy/data/src/reports/markdown/m_wiho6vrjbt68gemclnfj9we4azv8eobfrfcfv34x/mailings.md
```

* Edit `Caddyfile` (located at `/srv/docker/caddy/etc/Caddyfile`) to correct web server `hostname:port` according to your configuration

```
example.com:80 # => replace to your web server name, port

root * /srv/src

file_server
templates
encode gzip

try_files {path}.html {path}

redir   /reports          /
redir   /reports/         /
rewrite /reports/*        /reports/index.html

...
```

### Caddy container deployment

* Run Caddy container with the following command

```
docker run --rm -d --name caddy -p 80:80 \
  -v /srv/docker/caddy/etc/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile \
  -v /srv/docker/caddy/data/src/:/srv/src \
  caddy
```

* You can specify the following environment variables, to be different of their following default values, with `-e` flag

```
EMAIL_ADDR_CONTACT=contact@example.com # contact email address used on index page
```

* For examplle, to specify a contact email address used on index page use the following command

```
docker run --rm -d --name caddy -p 80:80 \
  -e "EMAIL_ADDR_CONTACT=infosec@example.com" \
  -v /srv/docker/caddy/etc/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile \
  -v /srv/docker/caddy/data/src/:/srv/src \
  caddy
```

## 'ZAP Mass Baseline' usage

### Build 'ZAP Mass Baseline' container image

* To build local **ZAP Mass Baseline** container image run the following command
 
```
docker build -t local/mass-baseline .
```

### Run 'ZAP Mass Baseline' container

* To scan target URLs maintained in `mailings.md` file of the corresponding directory run the following command (where `wiho6vrjbt68gemclnfj9we4azv8eobfrfcfv34x` is the ID of the directory of name `m_<ID>` with `mailings.md` file)

```
docker run --rm -d --name mass-baseline -u zap \
  -v /srv/docker/caddy/data/src/reports/markdown:/zap/wrk/:rw \
  local/mass-baseline mass-baseline.sh wiho6vrjbt68gemclnfj9we4azv8eobfrfcfv34x
```

* You can specify the following environment variables, to be different of their following default values, with `-e` flag

```
EMAIL_ADDR_FROM=noreply@example.com # email address from which email notifications will be sent
SMTP_HOST=example.com               # SMTP host used to send email notifications
SMTP_PORT=25                        # port on SMTP host used to send email notifications
HTTP_SCHEME=http                    # HTTP scheme used to form HTTP URLs
HTTP_DOMAIN=example.com             # HTTP domain used to form HTTP URLs
```

* For examplle, to specify an email address from which email notifications will be sent use the following command

```
docker run --rm -d --name mass-baseline -u zap \
  -e "EMAIL_ADDR_FROM=infosec@example.com" \
  -v /srv/docker/caddy/data/src/reports/markdown:/zap/wrk/:rw \
  local/mass-baseline mass-baseline.sh wiho6vrjbt68gemclnfj9we4azv8eobfrfcfv34x
```

* **ZAP Mass Baseline** container stores scanning results to the directories `/r_*` under `/srv/docker/caddy/data/src/reports/markdown`, where particular directories' names are specified in `mailings.md` file

### Access result reports (and list of target URLs)

* The following URLs can be used to access result reports and list of target URLs (here is the ID `wiho6vrjbt68gemclnfj9we4azv8eobfrfcfv34x` which corresponds to the described above directory structure)
  * `http://example.com/reports/m_wiho6vrjbt68gemclnfj9we4azv8eobfrfcfv34x/baseline-summary` - result reports, available as **ZAP Mass Baseline** container finishes
  * `http://example.com/reports/m_wiho6vrjbt68gemclnfj9we4azv8eobfrfcfv34x/mailings` - list of configured target URLs
